  <h2> This Waiting Game is Making Me Crazy </h2>

  <div class="col-12">
   <h3 id="unfulfilled-plans">Unfulfilled Plans.</h3>

<p>Have you ever been in the midst of a plan and thought…I am waiting for “X” to happen and then I will start or do “Z”? That’s pretty much where I am at. Approximately one year ago, my best friend and husband (for 24 years at that point) and I decided that we were “over” the 9-5 job, the big mortgage and the stationary life we were in the thick of. We had talked for nearly six months about what we could do to change the course we were on. We both love traveling and wanted to be able to do more of it but in our current home and careers, we were unable to do much. We went around and around with changes to lifestyle or jobs that could increase our ability to see and do more things together. We finally came to the conclusion that we were going to sell our house and go full-time in an RV. Now, what does this have to do with the question about waiting for “X to do Z?” I have been waiting to start blogging for the sale of our sticks and bricks and getting out on the road. Well, like I said, this plan hatched about twelve months ago. Yep! Still waiting for our beautiful home and property to sell. I am not a very patient person, and this has not sat well with me but what does a gal do? Continue to wait…patiently….sort of….not really.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2 id="heres-some-background-info">Here’s some background info</h2>

<p>I am a registered nurse and I was a director for a home health and hospice company and I quit my job and took a travel nursing gig for five months, thinking that surely our home would sell, and my hubby would join me in our new, rockin’ RV. It didn’t and so he didn’t. He does sales and service for a medical device company and can travel from anywhere and so between his career and mine, we can essentially live anywhere we would like. See why RV life is perfect for us? What is wrong with the universe? Why hasn’t this happened yet? Maybe it’s because we currently live where most people vacation.</p>

<h3 id="elevation-views-and-wildlife">Elevation, Views, and Wildlife</h3>

<p>We live at 8600’ in the mountains, surrounded by “quakies” and pines off of a dirt road. There is a ton of wildlife that includes moose, bears, badgers, deer and porcupines. We can hear the elk bugle in the early morning hours at the end of August and early part of September. The fall colors are AMAZING and vibrant shades of yellow and orange. And when it SNOWS! Imagine driving between white walls of snow that are taller than your jeep! We had over 30 FEET of snow at one point. And even with all of this crazy, wonderful piece of heaven where we live, we still want to sell everything and hit the road.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/moose@2x.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Although increasing in year-round living, most of the cabins in our neighborhood are exactly that. Cabins. People’s second homes where they come to escape the pressures, smog, and technology of their daily grind. We have loved where we live which made our decision to sell and RV full-time even more challenging. So, in short, our targeted buyers are looking for a wooded getaway or a place to retire.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sleding.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>To be fair, the house hasn’t been on the market for the whole year. It has been SEVEN long months. Here’s where, if this were paper, you would see smeared pen and wrinkles from my tears.</p>

<p>We are frustrated and disappointed because our dreams and plans of road tripping and adventures have gone unfulfilled to date (not that we have been sitting at home this whole time!) but that is why I have decided to start blogging now. I decided to show our progress to goals and really help me to keep my focus. Maybe this will be the commitment to the lifestyle required for the universe to get this plan in motion!</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h3>

<p>Figuring out what to do with ALL of the stuff acquired over 25 years of marriage and family all neatly tucked away in approximately 3600 sq. ft. What to keep, what to throw away, give away, or what’s worth some money to sell…so many decisions and apparently plenty of time to make them! I will keep you posted!</p>
