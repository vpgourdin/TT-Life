  <h2> Downsizing Is So Fun </h2>

  <div class="col-12">
   <h3 id="what-does-downsizing-look-like-to-me">What Does Downsizing Look Like to Me</h3>

<p>Have you ever looked into your closet and thought, “When did I get ALL of this stuff?” After we decided to sell our home and move into a motorhome full-time, my husband thought it would be a great idea if I started in my own closet… Is he crazy??? I LOVE everything, and I can’t possibly part with any of it! I have clothes and shoes for just about every occasion and definitely every season. At least I did.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/downsizing3@2x.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="my-secret">My Secret</h3>

<p>My secret to get this ball rolling was this…I am not going to fit in to those skinny jeans that I have been saving before they go back out of style and I like yoga pants waaaay better! I know. It’s harsh but it was the tough love required to get things moving out of my closet. Next, I went with, “if I haven’t worn it in the last 6 months.” I figured that this was a pretty safe bet to get a lot more things out of the closet. After that I narrowed it even more to the last 3 months. I was amazed at the amount of clothing that I was holding on to (for skinnier days) or just wasn’t wearing anymore. I also got rid of all my “office work” attire and only kept my absolute favorite pairs of scrubs. It began to feel really good to see things going for donation and my closet requirements were changing for the better.</p>

<p>If you ask my husband and kids what my favorite things are they would probably report the same list. Purses and bags, shoes (most definitely), and photography gear and gadgets. I think you can see where I am going with this. I will tackle the purses first. I whole heartedly believe that a person can NEVER have too many of these. Mostly because there are so many great ones in the world! There are bags in every color and pattern, for every season, or month, or week, or even daily (I think this is a little extreme because I can’t possibly change my junk from bag to bag that quick!) And they come in every shape and size and for every purpose you can think of. Oh…I am missing my bags and purses even as I write this! I won’t lie, I didn’t downsize this section of my life nearly enough, but I feel that when the time comes to move into the RV, more things will have to go.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/closet3-square.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Especially to make room for my shoes. I was able to eliminate most of my high heels with the office work attire, but I am a big fan of shoes and I still have a good-sized collection of them. I have very tiny feet and so when I find shoes that fit, several colors or styles may be in order. I may be starting a shoe buying support group in the future, if anyone is interested.</p>

<p>And on a happier note, I get to keep all my photography gear and gadgets, at least at this stage of the process. I also plan to add to this category as this journey expands, but I am keeping that a secret for now.</p>

<h3 id="a-little-too-downsized">A Little too Downsized</h3>

<p>After the closet purge, I started going room to room. I think that I may have stepped over the line just a little, and really only if are living in a house with a dishwasher, lots of cupboard space, and a large pantry. I decided that we had way too many dishes and a bunch of gadgets that weren’t going to fit in a small RV kitchen. The local church was having a fundraiser yard sale. Guess what? I had tons of stuff to donate! My family thought that was great until they realized that if they put any of the four plates or bowls that were remaining into the dishwasher, they didn’t have anything to eat on. Oops! We have been handwashing ever since. Great practice for RV living is my motto.</p>

<p>I also found that putting items on the local yard sale page was a great way to keep things moving. My oldest daughter is also thrilled to get lots of good kitchen gadgets and household décor to add to her home and the best part…she didn’t have to buy any of it! Not to mention all the junk that we have been throwing away. I am amazed at the amount of stuff one family can acquire! I am going to continue downsizing, dejunking, and simplifying our life while we wait for our house to sell.</p>

<p>I will keep you posted on our progress!</p>
